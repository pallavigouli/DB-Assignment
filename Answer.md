1)The relationship between the "product" and "product_category" entities in the provided schema is likely represented by a foreign key. The "product" table appears to have a column named "category_id" of type "int," which is likely a foreign key referencing the "id" column in the "product_category" table. This establishes a link between the two tables, indicating that each product is associated with a specific product category through the common key "category_id."

SELECT
    product.id AS product_id,
    product.name AS product_name,
    product.desc AS product_description,
    product.created_at AS product_created_at,
    product.modified_at AS product_modified_at,
    product_category.id AS category_id,
    product_category.name AS category_name,
    product_category.desc AS category_description
FROM
    product
JOIN
    product_category ON product.category_id = product_category.id;


2)To ensure that each product in the "product" table has a valid category assigned to it, i can enforce a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column. This constraint will ensure that every value in the "category_id" column in the "product" table references a valid entry in the "product_category" table. Here's an example of how i could create such a constraint:

     ALTER TABLE product
     ADD CONSTRAINT fk_product_category
     FOREIGN KEY (category_id)
     REFERENCES product_category(id);

This SQL statement adds a foreign key constraint named "fk_product_category" to the "product" table, specifying that the "category_id" column in "product" must reference the "id" column in the "product_category" table. If there's an attempt to insert or update a row in the "product" table with a "category_id" that doesn't exist in the "product_category" table, it will result in a foreign key violation error. This helps maintain data integrity and ensures that each product is associated with a valid category.
